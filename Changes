0.07    2008-06-26

- SELECT statements with multiple joins generated bogus SQL (a
  spurious comma separating JOIN clauses).


0.06    2008-03-06

- Allow a Fey::Column object to have a column with precision but no
  length, since Postgres allows this.


0.05    2008-02-20

- Some small tweaks to take advantage of recent Moose changes.

- Added Fey::FK->pretty_print().

- Some internal changes for the benefit of Fey::ORM.


0.04    2008-02-13

- Some SQL methods (order_by() and limit()) did not return the object
  on which they were called, so they broke method chaining.


0.03    2008-02-06

- Renamed the distro from Fey-Core to just Fey.

- Added automatic use of placeholders to Fey::SQL. Now when you pass
  literal values, the default is to convert them to placeholders. The
  values can be retrieved from the new
  bind_params(). method. Suggested by Daisuke Maki.


0.02    2008-02-05

- Moved Fey::Test to its own distro, and made it a build prereq.


0.01    2008-02-02

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
